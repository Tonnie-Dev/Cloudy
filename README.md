## cloudy ‚òÅÔ∏è
Cloudy is an open-source weather app for Android that provides users with up-to-date weather information based on their current location, as well as a week-long forecast. It is built using the latest Android technologies and follows the MVVM with clean architecture, with an offline-first approach that caches weather data for improved performance.

### Tech stack üèó
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Jetpack Components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) - Compose, ViewModel and more
- [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) & [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- [OkHttp3](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)
- [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/)
- [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/)

### Development Setup üíª
To build and run the app, you will need the latest version of Android Studio Giraffe (or newer) installed on your system.

### Weather API üòç
The weather data is provided by the [open-meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/), which does not require an API key. The app retrieves the user's location using the device's GPS and uses the latitude and longitude to fetch the current weather and forecast for the next seven days.

### Contributions üôå

### Todos üë∑
Here are some areas of improvement that I'm currently working on:
- Adopt unit tests to improve app stability
- Improve buildSrc to streamline app building
- Modularization improvements for better code structure
- Adopt Fastlane for for Google Play Store deployment
